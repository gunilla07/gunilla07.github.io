 In my younger and more vulnerable years <br /><br />
 my father gave me some advice that <br /><br />
 I've been turning over in my mind ever since.<br /><br />
"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," <br /><br />
he told me, <br /><br />
"just remember that all the people in this world<br /><br />
 haven't had the advantages that you've had." <br /><br />
 <br />

当有一天，我发现，我习惯写日记的地方不允许发表日志的时候，我就知道，这一天终于到来。
